        "We partnered with AS Software to modernize their Ultrasound Framework, a cloud-based platform designed to streamline reporting workflows and enhance healthcare efficiency. We upgraded their legacy software, transforming the outdated interface into a modern, user-friendly design while optimizing scalability and performance. Given the lack of detailed software documentation, we meticulously analyzed the system to document its functionalities comprehensively. Our team adopted FHIR standards to enhance interoperability with EHR/EMR systems, integrated a scalable engine for cost optimization, and developed new APIs for seamless communication. An interactive design prototype was created to refine the user experience, ensuring the transition to the updated platform did not disrupt existing workflows. Rigorous testing, including unit, regression, and end-to-end testing, guaranteed reliability. Our step-by-step feature release approach facilitated the deployment of federated settings and other enhancements to over 1,000 healthcare facilities across the U.S., with additional maintenance of their legacy HL7 module.",
